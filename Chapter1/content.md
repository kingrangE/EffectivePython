# PEP 8 Style

## Why should I use this?
1. Using a consistent style makes your code **more apporoachable and easier to read.**
2. It becomes easier to collaborate.
3. It makes easier to change your code later.
4. It can help to avoid common error

### Whitespace
- In Python, Whitespace is **syntactically significant**
    - Because
        1. It **determines code blocks**
        2. **Mandatory** (unlike other language)
            - In other language, Indentation is optional and for readability
- So Python programmers are especially sensitive to the effects of whitespace
- Guidelines
    1. **Use 4 spaces** instead of tabs
    2. **lines should be 79 characters** in length or less
    3. **Additional 4 indentations** in new lines if you are using **a long expression to make a new line**
    4. In a file, **Functions and classes** should be **separated by two blank lines**
    5. In a class, methods should be separated by one blank lines
    6. In dictionary, Don't put space between each key and colon, and put a single space before the corresponding value 
    7. Put one space and one space before and after the = operator(assignment)
    8. For type annotations, ensure that there is no separation between the variable name and the colon, and use a space before the type information
